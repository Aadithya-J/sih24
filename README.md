## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Gemini API key.

2. In the project root directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will install all necessary dependencies and start both the frontend and backend servers.

## Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading, use:

```bash
npm run dev
```

frontend - http://localhost:5173
backend - http://localhost:4000
